Google Analytics is a free web analytics service offered by Google that allows website owners to track and analyse their website traffic. It provides insights into the behaviour of visitors to a website, including how they found the site, how long they stayed, which pages they viewed, and what actions they took. With this information, website owners can make informed decisions about optimising their websites and improving their performance. Businesses, organisations, and individuals widely use Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of their online marketing campaigns, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. Google Analytics helps you to track and count visitors, traffic sources, goals, and conversion as it generates reports on Audience Analysis, Acquisition Analysis, Behavior Analysis and Conversion Analysis. 
Audience analysis gives us an overview of the audience who visit your site, their session history, technology, page views, and bounce rate.
Acquisition analysis is carried out to find out the sources from where your web traffic originates. We can use acquisition analysis to capture traffic from all channels, particular sources/mediums, and referrals. Moreover, trace traffic from AdWords (paid search). 
Behaviour analysis monitors users' activities on websites like Site Search and Site Speed.
Conversion is a goal completion or a transaction by a user on your website. For example, download, checkout and buy. The general illustration is in fig 2.

Google Web Analytics is not suitable for storing in Relational Database
The Google Web Analytics application domain captures and analyses large amounts of data from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms. The data is highly dynamic and constantly changing, and it needs to be processed in real-time to provide meaningful insights.
While Relational Databases are great for storing structured data, they may not be suitable for storing the vast and ever-changing data generated by Google Analytics. Relational Databases are great for storing structured data, but they may be better for storing and processing the enormous and ever-changing data generated by Google Analytics. Google Analytics offers a more cost-effective and scalable solution for storing and processing data.

There can be some reasons:
Data Volume: Google Analytics generates massive data that can quickly become unmanageable in a traditional Relational Database. The data size can cause performance issues and slow down the querying process.
Data Complexity: Google Analytics data is highly complex, with multiple data points and dimensions that change over time. Relational Databases may struggle to handle the complexity of this data, leading to poor performance and inaccurate results.
Real-Time Processing: Google Analytics data needs to be processed in real-time to provide meaningful insights. Relational Databases are not designed to handle real-time data processing, making them unsuitable for Google Analytics.
Scalability: Google Analytics is designed to handle millions of requests per second, making it highly scalable. However, Relational Databases may struggle to keep up with the demands of Google Analytics, leading to performance issues and downtime.
Cost: Storing and processing large amounts of data in a Relational Database can be expensive. Google Analytics offers a more cost-effective solution for storing and processing data.
Advantages of using NoSQL databases:
Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable horizontally and vertically, which means that they can handle large volumes of data and can be easily scaled up or down based on the needs of the application or organisation.
Flexibility: NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning data can be added or modified without a predefined schema which makes it easy to store unstructured data, such as social media feeds, log files, or sensor data.
Performance: NoSQL databases are optimised for performance, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. They can perform read-and-write operations faster than traditional relational databases.
Availability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly available, meaning that data is always accessible, even during hardware or network failures.
Cost: NoSQL databases are generally less expensive than traditional relational databases, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. They are also easier to scale, reducing the need for expensive hardware or software upgrades.

NoSQL Databases using Google Web Analytics
A document-based NoSQL database like MongoDB is the most suitable option for Google web analytics as it generates large amounts of data with varying structures, and a document-based NoSQL database can handle this type of data well. Document-based databases allow for flexible schema design, which is essential for unstructured data. In addition, MongoDB has built-in sharding capabilities that will enable it to scale horizontally as data volumes grow, which is necessary for a high-traffic site like Google. Its flexibility, scalability, and performance make it a perfect choice for storing and analysing large volumes of data generated by Google web analytics. Document-based databases offer a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data.
Advantages of Document-based databases:
Flexible data modelling: Document-based databases do not require a predefined schema, allowing for greater data modelling flexibility, meaning that data can be added or modified easily without changing the schema.
Scalability: Document-based databases can quickly scale horizontally by adding more nodes, which allows them to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
High performance: Document-based databases are optimised for high performance, especially for read-heavy workloads, and can deliver fast response times even with large data sets.
Rich querying capabilities: Document-based databases support rich querying capabilities, including ad-hoc queries, full-text search, and aggregation.
Easy integration: Document-based databases are designed to work with modern web and mobile application stacks, making integrating them with popular programming languages and frameworks easy.
Cost-effective: Document-based databases are often open-source and can be deployed on commodity hardware, which makes them a cost-effective option compared to traditional relational databases. 
Schema-less: There are no restrictions on the format and structure of data storage. This is good for retaining existing data at massive volumes and different structural states, especially in a continuously transforming system.

Google Web Analytics best Suits Combining Sharding and Replication
Google Analytics uses a distributed system to handle the massive amounts of data websites and applications generate, for which it requires a distribution model which combines sharding and replication.
Sharding involves splitting up an extensive database into smaller, more manageable chunks called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data and is stored on a separate server. This approach allows for faster data access and better scalability. In Google Analytics, sharding is used to split up the data based on the website or application that generated it. This means that each website or application has its own set of shards, and the data is stored separately from other websites or applications.
Replication involves creating multiple copies of the data and distributing them across different servers. This approach provides redundancy and ensures the data is always available, even if one server fails. In Google Analytics, replication creates multiple copies of the data within each shard. This means that each shard has multiple replicas stored on different servers. When a user queries the data, the query
