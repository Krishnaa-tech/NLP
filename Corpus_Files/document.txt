"Case Study: Unlocking Growth with Google Web Analytics"

Introduction
Google Analytics is a free web analytics service offered by Google that allows website owners to track and analyse their website traffic. It provides insights into the behaviour of visitors to a website, including how they found the site, how long they stayed, which pages they viewed, and what actions they took. With this information, website owners can make informed decisions about optimising their websites and improving their performance. Businesses, organisations, and individuals widely use Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of their online marketing campaigns, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates. Google Analytics helps you to track and count visitors, traffic sources, goals, and conversion as it generates reports on Audience Analysis, Acquisition Analysis, Behavior Analysis and Conversion Analysis. 
Audience analysis gives us an overview of the audience who visit your site, their session history, technology, page views, and bounce rate.
Acquisition analysis is carried out to find out the sources from where your web traffic originates. We can use acquisition analysis to capture traffic from all channels, particular sources/mediums, and referrals. Moreover, trace traffic from AdWords (paid search). 
Behavior analysis monitors users' activities on websites like Site Search and Site Speed.
Conversion is a goal completion or a transaction by a user on your website. For example, download, check out and buy. The interface is illustrated in Fig1.

Google Web Analytics is not suitable for storing in Relational Database
The Google Web Analytics application domain captures and analyses large amounts of data from various sources such as websites, mobile apps, and other digital platforms. The data is highly dynamic and constantly changing, and it needs to be processed in real-time to provide meaningful insights.
While Relational Databases are great for storing structured data, they may not be suitable for storing the vast and ever-changing data generated by Google Analytics. Relational Databases are great for storing structured data, but they may not be ideal for storing and processing the enormous and ever-changing data generated by Google Analytics. Google Analytics offers a more cost-effective and scalable solution for storing and processing data.
There can be some reasons:

•	Performance: NoSQL databases can offer faster read/write speeds than traditional relational databases, which is crucial for handling the real-time data streams generated by web analytics.
•	Cost: NoSQL databases are often more cost-effective than traditional relational databases because they can be run on commodity hardware and don't require expensive licensing fees.
•	Availability: NoSQL databases are designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant, meaning they can continue functioning even if one or more servers fail, which is critical for ensuring that Google Web Analytics is always available to users.

NoSQL Databases using Google Web Analytics
A document-based NoSQL database like MongoDB is the most suitable option for Google web analytics as it generates large amounts of data with varying structures, and a document-based NoSQL database can handle this type of data well. Document-based databases allow for flexible schema design, which is essential for unstructured data. In addition, MongoDB has built-in sharding capabilities that will enable it to scale horizontally as data volumes grow, which is necessary for a high-traffic site like Google. Its flexibility, scalability, and performance make it a perfect choice for storing and analysing large volumes of data generated by Google web analytics. Document-based databases offer a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective way to store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data.

Advantages of Document-based databases:
1.	Flexible data modelling: Document-based databases do not require a predefined schema, allowing for greater data modelling flexibility, meaning that data can be added or modified easily without changing the schema.
2.	Scalability: Document-based databases can quickly scale horizontally by adding more nodes, which allows them to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.
3.	High performance: Document-based databases are optimised for high performance, especially for read-heavy workloads, and can deliver fast response times even with large data sets.
4.	Rich querying capabilities: Document-based databases support rich querying capabilities, including ad-hoc queries, full-text search, and aggregation.
5.	Easy integration: Document-based databases are designed to work with modern web and mobile application stacks, making integrating them with popular programming languages and frameworks easy.
6.	Cost-effective: Document-based databases are often open-source and can be deployed on commodity hardware, which makes them a cost-effective option compared to traditional relational databases. 
7.	Schema-less: There are no restrictions on the format and structure of data storage. This is good for retaining existing data at massive volumes and different structural states, especially in a continuously transforming system.
8.	Faster creation and care: Minimal maintenance is required once you create the document, which can be as simple as adding your complex object once.


Google Web Analytics best Suits Combining Sharding and Replication
Google Analytics uses a distributed system to handle the massive amounts of data websites and applications generate, for which it requires a distribution model which combines sharding and replication.
Sharding involves splitting up an extensive database into smaller, more manageable chunks called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data and is stored on a separate server. This approach allows for faster data access and better scalability. In Google Analytics, sharding is used to split up the data based on the website or application that generated it. This means that each website or application has its own set of shards, and the data is stored separately from other websites or applications.
Replication involves creating multiple copies of the data and distributing them across different servers. This approach provides redundancy and ensures the data is always available, even if one server fails. In Google Analytics, replication creates multiple copies of the data within each shard. This means that each shard has multiple replicas stored on different servers. When a user queries the data, the query is routed to the closest replica to minimise latency. Combining sharding and replication provides a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system. Sharding allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, while replication ensures that the data is always available and can survive server failures. This approach also allows for easy scaling by adding more shards or replicas as needed.
A single-server approach is unsuitable for Google Web Analytics because it cannot handle the scale of data and traffic generated by the system. It serves millions of users and collects vast amounts of data, which requires a distributed architecture capable of handling high volumes of traffic and data. Moreover, A single-server approach would limit the system's scalability and increase the risk of downtime due to hardware failures, software updates, or maintenance. Furthermore, a single server would not provide the redundancy and fault tolerance necessary to ensure high availability and data integrity. Google Analytics uses a distribution model that combines sharding and replication to provide a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system for handling large volumes of data generated by websites and applications.
Peer-to-peer replication is a legitimate method for spreading data in a distributed system, but because of its complexity and potential difficulties with managing data consistency and synchronisation, it might not be the best method for Google Web Analytics. It also enables more effective workload and data distribution across the system because each server functions as a master and a slave. Nevertheless, this strategy can also be more challenging to manage because it needs more complex synchronisation techniques to guarantee data consistency and avoid conflicts between clones.
The size of Google Web Analytics system and the volume of data and traffic it processes, replicating and distributing data is enormous and must be done in a highly scalable and effective way. 
Sharding and master-slave replication offer a reliable and efficient method to accomplish this. Google Web Analytics can manage massive volumes of data and traffic while ensuring high availability and data consistency by splitting data into smaller chunks and replicating it across numerous servers.
Finally, Google Web Analytics combines sharding and master-slave replication due to their efficacy in managing massively distributed systems. The replication and sharding combination is illustrated in Fig 2.


Challenges of Using NoSQL Databases in Google Web Analytics
